# NYC Squirrels

## Ask:

You have been tasked by the New York City Parks & Rec department to summarize the latest squirrel census data (attached). NYC Parks is looking to you for any insights you can glean from the data. They are seeking to better understand the cityâ€™s extensive squirrel population (e.g., location, demographics, etc.). Your summary will help inform the entire department as it seeks to manage a population boom of these bushy tailed rodents.

## Data:

The attached data contains 36 columns and 3k+ observations with a mixture of data types. Data dictionary can be found on the original GitHub page here.

## Deliverable:

Using your medium of choice (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, etc.), summarize and present your findings in a dashboard to the department heads. Walk through how to utilize the dashboard and share any insights you gained while reviewing the information. Please keep your findings to one dashboard and keep your presentation to no more than 5 - 8 mins. Be prepared to answer questions about your work after the presentation.

## Notes:

Do your best to find a purpose with your dashboard.
Design and organization can be almost as important as the data you display.
After your presentation, please send your dashboard file to Data.Analytics@ipfs.com
