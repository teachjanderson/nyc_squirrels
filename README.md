# NYC Squirrel Census 2018

## Ask:

The New York City Parks & Rec department, with the help of many volunteers, collected a dataset of squirrel sightings and activities. This analysis summarizes the latest squirrel census data. 

## Data:

The attached data contains 36 columns and 3k+ observations with a mixture of data types. The original dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-10-29#nyc_squirrelscsv).

## Deliverable:

The squirrel census was illuminating and at times entertaining. The descriptive statistics had potential for error as they were collected by a variety of volunteers and observational. Nevertheless, the data was fairly free of errors and cleaning did not reveal any major gaps or issues beyond repair.

The squirrels in Central Park are Eastern Gray Squirrels who are, at times, known for a bit of destruction including shutting down the [New York Stock Exchange](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/10/business/stray-squirrel-shuts-down-nasdaq-system.html). Understandably, Squirrels probably prefer a bear market least of all. Of the squirrels observed, most had predominantly gray fur with a smaller percentage cinnamon or red and least of all black.

The majority of the squirrels identified were adults. The average lifespan of a squirrel in the wild may be between 3-8 years. Many squirrels reach maturity quickly and it's likely the adult category contains a healthy population of younger squirrels.

It was presumed many of the squirrels would be sighted near or around the water sources in Central Park, however this was not always the case. The largest water source in the park did not translate to the greatest number of squirrels in its proximity. This may be due to the geography in and around the water, the openness of predators, or greater abundance of humans or lack thereof (as a potential food source). 

For those wishing to observe and interact with squirrels having black fur, areas south and north have a greater abundance than the middle area. As further studies collect more data, it will be interesting to map this population to see if it changes location or increases in size.

While a third of all squirrels were seen either eating or foraging, the red or cinnamon squirrel was seen more actively involved with food. Red squirrels are more known for activity, so they may likewise be interacting more openly with food sources. The black squirrel was the least interactive when it came to eating and foraging, potentially indicating it had already stored or was more isolating when eating or hiding food. This continues to paint a picture that observing and interacting with black fur squirrels may prove a difficult yet worthwhile adventure for New York's park goers.   

## Final Thoughts and Insights:

The squirrel census revealed many descriptive statistics about the squirrels in New York City, but it is just a starting point. 

A few considerations as continued datasets are compiled:

* What could the squirrel census teach us about the comings and going of animals in urban areas? 

* Clearly a domesticated animal, what can we glean from these squirrels and their ability to adapt overtime? As more development encroaches animal populations, could cohabitation of humans and animals strike a better balance? 

* There is quite the history of the gray squirrel in New York City. As a continuation of the question above, how has the squirrel population been doing in New York? What are the hindrances to growth and is there an size limit for healthy sustainability?

* What is the general attitude of citizens towards the squirrels of New York?
